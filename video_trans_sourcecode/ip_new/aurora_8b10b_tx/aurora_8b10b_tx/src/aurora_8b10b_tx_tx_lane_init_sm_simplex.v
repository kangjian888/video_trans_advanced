//  TX_LANE_INIT_SM_SIMPLEX
//
//
//  Description: This logic manages the initialization of the V5 in simplex
//               2-byte mode.  It consists of a small state machine, counters
//               for tracking the progress of initializtion and detecting
//               problems, and some additional support logic.
