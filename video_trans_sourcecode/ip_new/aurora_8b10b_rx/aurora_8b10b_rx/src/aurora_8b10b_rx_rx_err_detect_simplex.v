//  RX_ERR_DETECT_SIMPLEX_V5
//
//
//  Description : The RX_ERR_DETECT_SIMPLEX_V5 module monitors the V5
//                to detect hard errors.  It accumulates the Soft errors
//                according to the leaky bucket algorithm described in the
//                Aurora Specification to detect Hard errors.  All errors
//                are reported to the Global Logic Interface.
//
//                * Supports V5
