Inappropriate max delay with datapath only option  
A max delay constraint with -datapath_only has been applied between tri_mode_ethernet_mac_0_0/inst/tri_mode_ethernet_mac_i/tri_mode_ethernet_mac_0_core/stats_block.statistics_counters/rd_data_ref_reg[71]/C and tri_mode_ethernet_mac_0_0/inst/tri_mode_ethernet_mac_i/tri_mode_ethernet_mac_0_core/stats_block.statistics_counters/ip2bus_data_reg[3]/D. The startpoint(s) and endpoint(s) either belong to the same clock domain or belong to two clock domains that can safely be timed together (without valid synchronizer). It is only recommended to use the -datapath_only option on paths between clocks that do not have a known phase relationship. This DRC is waived when a synchronizer is found on the path endpoint

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -filter {NAME =~ */async_rst*/CLR}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '16' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
